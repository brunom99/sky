A simple Go project to discover websockets, goroutines and mutex.

Each goroutine is illustrated by a aircraft moving on the grid.

There are 3 types of aircraft: common, light and dark.

- Dark aircrafts destroy common aircrafts and replicate themselves.
- Light aircrafts destroy dark aircrafts.

Execute the command "go run main.go" and navigate to http://localhost:1984/

You can change parameters in the config file "config.toml".
